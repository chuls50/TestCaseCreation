## Test Execution Checklist

- [ ] Test environment is configured and accessible
- [ ] eNOW application link is available and functional
- [ ] Test accounts are created with known registered email addresses
- [ ] List of unregistered email addresses is prepared for negative testing
- [ ] All required browsers are installed and updated to latest versions
- [ ] Network connectivity is stable for backend validation checks
- [ ] Test data spreadsheet is prepared with registered/unregistered email lists

## Defect Reporting Guidelines

When a test case fails, document the following information:

1. **Test Case ID**: Reference the specific test case that failed
2. **Steps to Reproduce**:
   - List exact steps taken that led to the defect
   - Include all test data used
3. **Expected Result**: What should have happened (from test case)
4. **Actual Result**: What actually happened
5. **Screenshots/Evidence**:
   - Capture screenshot of the error or unexpected behavior
   - Include browser console logs if applicable
6. **Environment Details**:
   - Browser name and version
   - Operating system
   - Test environment URL
   - Date and time of test execution
7. **Severity Level**:
   - **Critical**: Blocks user from logging in (e.g., TC-LOG-001, TC-LOG-024 failures)
   - **High**: Validation not working properly (e.g., TC-LOG-015, TC-LOG-022 failures)
   - **Medium**: UI elements missing or incorrect (e.g., TC-LOG-002, TC-LOG-004 failures)
   - **Low**: Minor visual or text issues
8. **Additional Notes**: Any other relevant information or observations

## Test Execution Notes

- Execute test cases in the order presented for optimal flow
- Login screen display tests (TC-LOG-001 through TC-LOG-007) should be executed first
- Language functionality tests require verification in multiple languages
- Email validation tests should use diverse test data to cover edge cases
- Registered vs. unregistered email tests require specific test data preparation
- Consider testing across different browsers for comprehensive coverage
- Document any unexpected behavior even if test passes
