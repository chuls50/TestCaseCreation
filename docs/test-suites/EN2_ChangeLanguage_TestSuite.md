## Defect Reporting Guidelines

When a test case fails, document the following information:

1. **Test Case ID**: Reference the specific test case that failed
2. **Steps to Reproduce**:
   - List exact steps taken that led to the defect
   - Include language selections made
   - Document current vs. expected language settings
3. **Expected Result**: What should have happened (from test case)
4. **Actual Result**: What actually happened
5. **Screenshots/Evidence**:
   - Capture screenshot of the Change language screen
   - Include screenshot of My account tab showing language setting
   - Document dropdown contents if relevant
6. **Environment Details**:
   - Browser name and version
   - Operating system
   - Test environment URL
   - User account used for testing
   - Date and time of test execution
7. **Severity Level**:
   - **Critical**: Cannot save language changes (e.g., TC-CHL-015 failure)
   - **High**: Cancel or Save buttons not working (e.g., TC-CHL-011, TC-CHL-017 failures)
   - **Medium**: UI elements missing or incorrect states (e.g., TC-CHL-003, TC-CHL-008 failures)
   - **Low**: Minor visual or ordering issues (e.g., TC-CHL-006 failure)
8. **Additional Notes**:
   - Document any language-specific rendering issues
   - Note if issue occurs with specific language selections only

## Test Execution Notes

- Execute test cases in the order presented for optimal flow
- Screen display tests (TC-CHL-001 through TC-CHL-004) should be executed first
- Test Cancel functionality before Save functionality to avoid test data conflicts
- Language dropdown tests require careful verification of alphabetical ordering
- Some tests require specific initial language settings - prepare test data accordingly
- Consider testing language persistence across browser sessions
- Verify that language changes affect only the user's session, not global settings
- Document dropdown behavior differences across browsers if observed
