- [ ] All required browsers are installed and updated to latest versions
- [ ] Email testing capability is set up to verify invitation emails
- [ ] Multiple institutions are configured for multi-institution admin testing
- [ ] Test data spreadsheet is prepared with user names, emails, roles, and states
- [ ] Network connectivity is stable for user management operations
- [ ] Screenshots tool is ready for defect documentation
- [ ] Test execution log template is prepared
- [ ] Coordinator role (formerly Clinician) is verified to exist in system
- [ ] Provider onboarding screens are available for testing role-specific features

## Defect Reporting Guidelines

When a test case fails, document the following information:

1. **Test Case ID**: Reference the specific test case that failed
2. **Steps to Reproduce**:
   - List exact steps taken that led to the defect
   - Include all user data entered (names, emails, roles)
   - Document filter/search criteria used
3. **Expected Result**: What should have happened (from test case)
4. **Actual Result**: What actually happened
5. **Screenshots/Evidence**:
   - Capture screenshot of the Manage Users screen showing the issue
   - Include screenshot of Invite User popup if relevant
   - Capture email inbox screenshots for invitation-related defects
   - Document role chips, toggle states, or filter results visually
6. **Environment Details**:
   - Browser name and version
   - Operating system
   - Test environment URL
   - Admin account used for testing
   - Institution context
   - Date and time of test execution
7. **Severity Level**:
   - **Critical**: Cannot invite users, cannot manage roles, cannot access Manage Users screen (e.g., TC-AUM-001, TC-AUM-038 failures)
   - **High**: Search/filter not working, toggle not functioning, roles not adding/removing (e.g., TC-AUM-013, TC-AUM-043, TC-AUM-047, TC-AUM-052, TC-AUM-055 failures)
   - **Medium**: UI elements missing, button states incorrect, minor functional issues (e.g., TC-AUM-009, TC-AUM-032, TC-AUM-045 failures)
   - **Low**: Visual issues, ordering problems, non-critical edge cases (e.g., TC-AUM-012, TC-AUM-065 failures)
8. **Additional Notes**:
   - Document any data corruption or unintended side effects
   - Note if issue is role-specific or institution-specific
   - Include any error messages from console or UI

## Test Execution Notes

- Execute Manage Users screen display tests (TC-AUM-001 through TC-AUM-012) first
- Search and filter tests should be executed before role management tests to avoid test data conflicts
- Prepare test users in various states before starting execution
- Invite User popup tests require email testing capability
- Role management tests may modify user data - document changes carefully
- Active toggle tests require coordination with user login testing
- Some tests (e.g., TC-AUM-049, TC-AUM-053, TC-AUM-056) require logging in as different users
- Consider testing across different browsers for comprehensive coverage
- Multi-institution tests require admin accounts with access to multiple institutions
- Document the state of each test user before and after testing
- Resend Invite tests require unregistered invited users
- Provider onboarding verification requires working Provider role functionality
- Last Updated timestamp tests may be time-sensitive
- Execute edge case tests (TC-AUM-062 through TC-AUM-066) last
