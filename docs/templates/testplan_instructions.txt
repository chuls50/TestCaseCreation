Given a user story for a feature that contains well defined scenarios
Given the scenarios outlined in the user story are defined in Gherkin Syntax

Analyze the requirements for each scenario in the given user story and output them into a table with the following columns:

|Scenario Name| Requirement | Test Case|

If a Scenario has multiple requirements, or if the requirements have multiple test cases, please skip a line like so:

|Scenario Number 1: Scenario Name| Requirement | Test Case|
                                 | Requirement | Test Case|
                                               | Test Case|

|Scenario Number 2: Scenario Name| Requirement | Test Case|
                                 | Requirement | Test Case|
                                               | Test Case|                                            
                                             

Then for each test case I want to know the following:

|ScenarioNumber.RequirementNumber | Test Scenario| Expected Result| Test Data|

For example:
